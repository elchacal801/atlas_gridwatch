# Global Undersea Cable Chokepoints and Landing Clusters: A Strategic Risk Assessment

## Introduction: Digital Lifelines and Hidden Chokepoints

Modern civilization runs on a vast undersea cable network that carries over 95-99% of intercontinental data traffic 1 2. These fiber-optic "digital lifelines" underpin everything from high-frequency financial trades and SWIFT banking transactions to cloud computing and AI workloads. Nearly $10 trillion in daily financial transactions and even latency-sensitive AI interactions depend on subsea cables 3. Despite their criticality, this infrastructure remains largely invisible and surprisingly vulnerable. Cables—typically only a few centimeters thick—traverse oceans and converge in narrow passages and coastal landing sites, creating geographic chokepoints where disruptions can have outsized ripple effects.

Physical and geopolitical factors funnel many cables along the same routes - for example, through narrow straits and clustered landing stations - leading to single points of failure in the global internet. Brief cable outages have slowed stock exchanges and payment systems 1, and major cable cuts have abruptly knocked entire regions offline. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of undersea telecom cable density, chokepoints, and landing station clusters, identifying global patterns and high-risk zones. We examine redundancy (or lack thereof) in these networks, review past failures (from the 2008 Mediterranean cuts to the 2023 Red Sea attacks) and their impacts, and assess emerging risks posed by new infrastructure projects (e.g. Chinese vs. U.S.-backed cables and private hyperscaler systems). Finally, we consider how this submarine cable web underpins global cloud and AI infrastructure, and present risk matrices by region to evaluate resilience and vulnerabilities.

## Global Cable Density and Major Routes

**Undersea Cable Scale & Distribution:** As of 2025, over 570 active submarine cable systems span ~1.4-1.5 million kilometers of ocean, with roughly 80 additional cables under construction 4. These cables land at more than 1,700 landing points worldwide (up from 1,444 in 2023 to 1,636 in 2024) 5. Importantly, cable landings are unevenly distributed: there are dense clusters in regions with major data hubs—notably Asia-Pacific, Europe, and North America - while transit regions like the Middle East and East Africa host critical junctions for intercontinental routes 6. Rather than a mesh covering all coasts evenly, cables concentrate along a few high-capacity "trunk" routes. The North Atlantic, for instance, carries massive traffic between North America and Europe; similarly, the Mediterranean-Red Sea corridor links Europe with Asia via the Suez, and the Strait of Malacca links the Indian and Pacific Oceans 7. This network design reflects efficiency and geography - but it creates systemic vulnerabilities, since vast volumes of data rely on a small number of physical pathways 7.

**Physical Chokepoints:** Many cables are funneled through tight maritime chokepoints and narrow straits due to geography. Notable global chokepoints include:

* **Bab-el-Mandeb (Red Sea / Gulf of Aden):** A bottleneck between the Horn of Africa and Arabian Peninsula that all Europe-to-Asia cables via Suez must transit 8 9. Nearly a dozen major systems (e.g. SEA-ME-WE 5, AAE-1, EIG, 2Africa) run through the Red Sea into this narrow strait. This concentration means any disruption here can sever Europe-Asia connectivity.
* *Figure: The map below highlights the dense cable cluster through Egypt and the Red Sea; virtually all cables connecting Europe with Asia/Africa squeeze through this corridor*


* **Strait of Gibraltar and Mediterranean:** The gateway between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean sees many cables entering/exiting Europe. Similarly, the Turkish Straits (Bosporus/Dardanelles) form a tight route for Black Sea regional cables 9.
* **Strait of Hormuz and Gulf of Oman:** Cables from the Persian Gulf are forced through Hormuz into the Gulf of Oman. Geopolitical constraints narrow this route - for example, Iranian waters are largely avoided, pushing cables closer together in Omani waters 10. Essentially all Gulf states' international cables exit via Oman, making this a critical choke area.
* **Strait of Malacca:** The primary passage from the Indian Ocean to the South China Sea, bordering Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia. Many intra-Asian and Asia-Europe cables traverse or branch near Malacca, given Singapore's role as a hub. Malacca's heavy shipping traffic and shallow channels pose physical risk (anchor drags, fishing) similar to other chokepoints.
* **English Channel:** The channel between the UK and France is another high-density corridor with numerous cables linking the UK to continental Europe. It has been a cable route since the first telegraph cable in 1850 and remains a key European cross-connect. High cable density in the English Channel makes it a noted chokepoint 11.
* **Strait of Florida:** Cables linking the U.S. to Latin America and the Caribbean cluster through the Florida Strait (between Florida and Cuba/Bahamas). This is cited among the highest-density cable corridors 11. For example, multiple systems run from South Florida to Brazil or across to Jamaica and Mexico, concentrating near Miami and Boca Raton.
* **Isthmus of Panama:** While some cable systems cross Central America terrestrially, the region near the Panama Canal is a focal area for cables bridging the Pacific and Caribbean. Panama's geography forces cables into proximity (or to use overland fiber across the isthmus), effectively making it a strategic junction 11.

Other notable pinch-points include the Luzon Strait (between Taiwan and the Philippines, where multiple Pacific cables converge and where undersea earthquakes in 2006 famously cut several cables at once) and various passages in the Indonesian archipelago that intra-Asian cables thread through. Geographic chokepoints concentrate risk: as one U.S. Homeland Security analysis noted, while major incidents in such chokepoints are relatively rare, each underscores the vulnerability of regions where cables are similarly concentrated 12 13.

**Landing Station Megaclusters:** Beyond narrow straits, cable landing stations (CLS) in certain coastal cities have become megaclusters, hosting many cables in one locale. These clusters arise near major internet hubs where data centers and terrestrial networks converge. Key examples:

* **Marseille, France:** Now a Mediterranean cable super-hub, Marseille has 16 subsea cables landing (as of 2021) with more in development 14. Cables from Asia, Africa, and the Middle East all terminate in Marseille to interconnect with European networks. This city's strategic location and carrier-neutral data centers (e.g. MRS1-MRS4 campuses) have attracted a concentration of systems including SEA-ME-WE 4 & 5, AAE-1, EIG, PEACE, and the new 2Africa and SEA-ME-WE 6 cables 15 16. Marseille's cluster exemplifies high capacity but also high co-dependence: simultaneous cuts near Marseille have impacted multiple major cables and routes - for instance, in 2022 several cables from Marseille toward Europe were cut, disrupting connectivity to Asia, Europe, and the US 17.
* **Djibouti:** On the Red Sea side of Bab-el-Mandeb, Djibouti is a landing hub for East African and Asia-Europe cables (e.g. SEA-ME-WE systems, AAE-1, EASSY). Its strategic position at the Red Sea mouth means many cables meet there, making Djibouti both a chokepoint and a cluster.
* **Singapore:** A key Asian exchange, Singapore links cables from the Indian Ocean (via Malaysia/Indonesia) to those across the South China Sea and Pacific. It serves as a landing for dozens of cables and will have seven new cables landing in coming years 18. Nearby Tuas (Singapore) and Changi are landing sites for systems like APCN-2, AAG, INDIGO, etc. The dense web around Singapore/Malaysia makes the region critical for intra-Asia traffic.
* **Florida (USA):** The southeastern Florida coast hosts a cluster of U.S. landing stations, grouped in three primary locations in Florida 19. Nearly all cables between the U.S. and Latin America land in these areas (e.g. in Miami, Palm Beach, Jacksonville). Most Florida landing sites are designed to support multiple cables, creating high density. For example, Boca Raton/Pompano area carries multiple Caribbean cables, and Miami/Fort Lauderdale area has several to Brazil. This clustering raises concern that a localized event (hurricane storm surge, sabotage, etc.) could affect many systems.
* **U.S. Mid-Atlantic (Virginia Beach):** In recent years, Virginia Beach emerged as a hub for transatlantic cables (e.g. MAREA, BRUSA, Dunant). Multiple high-capacity cables land in close proximity there, attracted by nearby data hubs (Ashburn, VA). While not as large as Florida, it's a significant cluster on the U.S. East Coast.
* **Pacific Northwest (USA/Canada):** Several Trans-Pacific cables land in a cluster on the U.S. West Coast around Oregon and Washington (e.g. Pacific City, OR and Seattle, WA landings), as this offers a great-circle route to North Asia. These landing points (and analogous ones in Japan) cluster cables within a narrow coastal stretch. Likewise, Southern California (Los Angeles area) historically had many Trans-Pacific landings (though new projects have shifted north to avoid certain waters). Both clusters mean regional hazards (like a major earthquake along the Cascadia subduction zone in the Pacific Northwest) could sever multiple links to Asia simultaneously.
* **UK & Northern Europe:** The UK is extremely well-connected (over 50 international cables) and has clusters in Cornwall (Bude), London area, etc. Northern France (Lannion, Dunkirk), the Netherlands, and Denmark also have clusters where transatlantic or intra-Europe cables land. For instance, a large number of transatlantic cables terminate in a few spots along the English coast and in New Jersey/Long Island on the U.S. side—not one city, but still concentrated regionally. This distribution means the North Atlantic route, while having many parallel cables, still concentrates in a limited set of landing areas for each end 7.
* **East Asia Hubs:** Japan (especially Chiba and Shima) has major landing sites where many cables from across the Pacific and around Asia terminate - one metro in Japan (e.g. Shima) hosts 11 cables in the vicinity 20. Hong Kong historically was a landing hub for East Asian cables, though geopolitical concerns have slowed new U.S.-linked cables there. Taiwan and South Korea each have multiple cables but are also relatively proximate (Taiwan's two main landing areas see many cables, some of which have been repetitively damaged in recent years).

Clustering at landing stations is a double-edged sword: it creates efficient interconnection points, but also means damage or attacks at one site can knock out many cables at once. Landing stations supply power to cables and tie into terrestrial grids 21; yet they often were chosen for ease of permitting or proximity to infrastructure rather than physical security 22. As a result, cable landings often sit in unremarkable coastal facilities that could be vulnerable to sabotage (e.g. a well-placed explosive or power cut)—a risk recognized by European cybersecurity agencies 23. For example, a 2022 incident in Marseille saw multiple cable cuts (suspected sabotage) at once, illustrating the cluster risk 17.

## High-Risk Regions: Geopolitical and Physical Vulnerabilities

Certain regions stand out as especially high-risk for cable disruption, whether due to geopolitical tensions, conflict, natural hazards, or simply the lack of alternate routes. Below we analyze several hotspots:

* **Red Sea & Suez (Egypt):** Perhaps the world's most critical cable chokepoint. Dozens of Europe-Asia and Africa-Europe cables all funnel through Egypt, landing on the Red Sea coast (e.g. at Zafarana/Suez) and again on the Mediterranean coast (Alexandria) before continuing onward 24. This tight bottleneck means Egypt's "Marine Route" is a single point whose failure would isolate entire regions. The vulnerability became clear in June 2022 when both the AAE-1 and SEA-ME-WE-5 cables were cut near Egypt, causing significant outages 25. Egypt's unique geography—the thin Sinai corridor leaves no truly diverse path; every cable between Asia and Europe runs through two landing sites ~160 km apart. Moreover, geopolitical issues compound risk: Eritrea's restrictive permit stance forces all Red Sea cables into Yemeni waters 25, where conflict has led to deliberate attacks on infrastructure. In late 2023, during regional conflict, multiple undersea cables in the Red Sea were cut. On Feb 24, 2024, three major cables (AAE-1, EIG, and SEACOM/Tata) were severed in the Red Sea, an incident reportedly caused by a ship's anchor after the vessel was damaged by Houthi missiles 27 28. This single event disrupted internet service to over 100 million people across Africa and West Asia and knocked out 70% of data traffic between Europe and Asia 29. The impacts rippled from East Africa (Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique, etc. saw 10-30% drops in traffic 30 31) to South Asia. Notably, some traffic (financial, cloud) had to be rerouted all the way around the globe via North America to bridge Europe-Asia during repairs 32. Such incidents highlight that Egypt/Red Sea is a true single point of failure for intercontinental connectivity. Deliberate attacks are also a concern: Yemen's Houthi rebels have explicitly threatened Red Sea cables amid regional conflicts 33. Indeed, ongoing conflict has delayed repairs - in 2024 the Yemeni government withheld permits to repair a cut on AAE-1 because one consortium member was under Houthi control, stalling fixes for 8+ weeks 34 35. Risk here is extremely high, combining geopolitical threat, terrorism (mines, drones or mines could target cables/shores), and zero alternative routes (the only theoretical alternative is an overland cable across Israel/Arabian peninsula, but that is nascent).
* **Taiwan Strait & Luzon Strait (East Asia):** Northeast Asia's cables are increasingly at risk due to political tensions and natural hazards. Taiwan lies amidst critical routes between Southeast Asia, Japan, and the U.S. and is connected by a handful of cables to the global internet (mostly landing on the southern coast toward Hong Kong and Philippines). Taiwan experiences 7-8 cable breaks per year, many suspected to be caused by Chinese fishing or dredging vessels dropping anchors or nets 36. For example, a February 2023 incident saw a Chinese freighter's anchor cut two cables linking Taiwan to outlying islands, leading to an unprecedented prison sentence for the captain 37 38. Taiwan authorities view these repeated cuts as a form of gray-zone pressure, although Beijing claims they are accidents. In the event of open conflict, Taiwan's cables would be prime targets for a blockade - effective cyber isolation via cutting cables. Additionally, the Luzon Strait, just south of Taiwan, sits on the seismically active Pacific "Ring of Fire." In December 2006 a 7.0 earthquake in this area broke at least six major cables, disrupting internet across East Asia (Taiwan, Hong Kong, China, Singapore) for weeks. The Luzon Strait remains an area where multiple cables (to Hong Kong, Taiwan, Philippines) run close together through an earthquake-prone zone—a natural single point of failure. Geopolitical risk around Taiwan is currently among the highest globally, and any conflict could see intentional sabotage of cables, as NATO intelligence has warned in light of great-power tensions 39.
* **South China Sea:** The South China Sea (SCS) is a dual risk environment - geopolitically contested and physically harsh. It hosts 11 major international cables linking Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, etc., and China itself has ~15 cables in these waters that form its connectivity to the world 40. The SCS's shallow sections and busy maritime traffic lead to very frequent cable faults - at least one cable failure every few weeks on average 41 (often due to fishing trawlers or ship anchors). Repairing cables here has become harder: due to territorial disputes, permits now face delays of up to four months (where it used to take 10 days) as Chinese authorization is needed in claimed waters 42. In 2022-2023, this dynamic played out when all five undersea cables connecting Vietnam were cut or damaged simultaneously, slashing Vietnam's international capacity by 75% 43. With nearby repair ships tied up and permitting snarls, it took eight months to fully restore Vietnam's cables 44 42 during which telecom providers had to scramble for satellite or overland alternatives. Such delays are now the norm in the SCS, raising concern that a concerted attack in these disputed waters could have prolonged impact. The U.S.-China tech rivalry has also affected cable development: at least six new cable projects (totaling >50,000 km) have been delayed, rerouted, or halted in the last five years due to SCS tensions 45. The U.S. has blocked new cables landing in Chinese territory (especially Hong Kong) over spying fears 46. Consequently, recent U.S.-backed cables avoid the SCS entirely, opting to route south of Indonesia or via the Pacific. The result is less diversity - most cables now skirt the edges of the SCS, or go via alternate paths (e.g. through Guam or Australia) which adds length and cost 47 48. In summary, the SCS is high-risk for both inadvertent damage (frequent) and potential state-sponsored sabotage or leverage in a crisis, with repairs hampered by geopolitics.
* **Persian Gulf:** The Gulf has relatively few exits for cables. Most regional connectivity (for Gulf states like UAE, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, etc.) runs through the Strait of Hormuz to Oman. Political frictions—e.g. Iran's limits on cable routes - have forced all cables to one side. TeleGeography notes that Iran denies permits for cables through its waters, effectively forcing cables to cluster in Omani territory, which halves the available route space 10. This means a single mishap in that narrow Omani zone could damage multiple systems. Additionally, the Gulf's shallow waters are filled with shipping and oil infrastructure, raising accidental damage odds. There have been cable cuts in the Gulf (e.g. the FALCON cable cuts off Dubai and between Qatar-UAE in 2008 49 50), which, combined with limited alternative paths, caused major outages. Geopolitical conflict is a looming risk: in a potential Iran-U.S. or regional conflict, undersea cables could be targeted or collateral damage (mines/ship attacks in Hormuz could easily snag cables). The risk is mitigated somewhat by new cables planned via the Red Sea and terrestrial routes (e.g. Saudi Arabia is developing cross-country fiber links to bypass Hormuz), but for now redundancy is limited.
* **North Atlantic & Northern Europe:** The transatlantic corridor has many parallel cables, but recent incidents show new risks. In 2022 and 2023, mysterious cuttings in the Baltic Sea - far north of typical transatlantic routes—raised alarms. In October 2023, a Hong Kong-flagged ship damaged two subsea cables and a gas pipeline in the Baltic; in late 2024, a Chinese vessel ("Yi Peng 3") was suspected of severing cables connecting Finland, Sweden, and Lithuania 51. Around the same time, a Russian "shadow fleet" vessel cut power and telecom cables in the Gulf of Finland 39. These incidents, amid the Russia-Ukraine war, suggest a heightened threat of state-sponsored sabotage in NATO's backyard. NATO intelligence has explicitly warned that Russia could target undersea cables to retaliate against Western support for Ukraine 39. The UK, Norway, and other North Sea nations have increased patrols after unexplained cable disruptions. The North Atlantic itself is deep and wide, making intentional cable cutting harder to detect or attribute—a fact not lost on military planners. While no major transatlantic cable cut has occurred in recent memory, the perceived threat is high. The UK in 2020 even termed undersea cables "existential" critical infrastructure. Notably, the concentration of cables landing in the UK, France, and U.S. Northeast means a coordinated sabotage at those clusters (by divers or submersibles) could sever multiple links. Russia has a specialized submarine (the Belgorod with Losharik minisub) for deep-sea operations that Western officials believe could cut cables on the ocean floor. Thus, while the North Atlantic has ample capacity, it is not immune to low-probability, high-impact risks.
* **West Africa:** Historically under-connected, West Africa now has several major cables (WACS, ACE, MainOne, 2Africa soon, etc.) mostly landing in just a few countries (e.g. Nigeria, Ghana, Senegal, Côte d'Ivoire). Cables often cluster at single points (for example, multiple systems coming ashore near Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire - Figure 1 shows a cluster of 6 cables there). This region faces both man-made and natural hazards. In March 2024, an underwater landslide in the Congo Canyon (off Côte d'Ivoire) cut four submarine cables (including WACS and others) at once 52. With many West African nations depending on those few cables, the slide caused widespread connectivity losses. The event illustrated how closely laid cables can all fall victim to a single geological event 53. Compounding the issue, repair capabilities in Africa are limited—at the time, only one repair ship (Léon Thévenin) served the entire region, delaying fixes 54. Some affected countries had to wait weeks or months for restoration. This lack of local repair assets means any major cut in West Africa can be prolonged (a risk factor also noted in South Africa's May 2024 dual cable cut, which took long to repair). On the security side, West African cables run mostly offshore, but piracy or terrorist groups haven't yet targeted them. Still, instability ashore (e.g. in landing countries) and low redundancy make this region vulnerable to extended outages from even accidental breaks.
* **United States West Coast:** The U.S. West Coast is the gateway for Trans-Pacific cables. Cables land primarily in two clusters: the Pacific Northwest (Oregon/Washington) and Southern California. The Pacific Northwest route is attractive for cables to Japan/Korea (shorter great-circle path), so multiple high-capacity cables land in a small area around Pacific City, OR and further north. Meanwhile, older cables to East Asia and newer ones to Southeast Asia land near Los Angeles. Natural disasters pose the biggest risk here: an extreme earthquake off Washington/Oregon (Cascadia subduction zone) could generate undersea landslides that sever multiple Pacific cables simultaneously. Likewise, Southern California's risk comes from seismic activity and coastal mudslides. While the U.S. has many cables, losing the majority of West Coast links (in a worst case) would force Asian traffic to reroute via Europe or satellite, dramatically increasing latency (unacceptable for many cloud and financial services). The U.S. Navy and Coast Guard also consider deliberate threats—e.g. concerns that adversary submarines could tap or cut cables near shore, though robust monitoring exists near key military hubs. Overall, the West Coast has moderate risk: high impact if multiple cables fail, but also significant domestic capacity that can reroute some traffic overland to East Coast links if needed.

**Summary:** Regions combining dense cable convergence and high threat levels (like the Red Sea, Taiwan/SCS, and parts of Europe's periphery) present the greatest systemic risk. In many cases, redundancy on paper proves insufficient in practice—e.g. having 4 cables in one trench is no help if an anchor or landslide cuts all four together. The next section examines how redundancy (or lack thereof) plays into resilience.

## Redundancy vs. Single Points of Failure

Global network resilience hinges on route diversity and spare capacity—effectively, having alternate pathways when a cable fails. In well-connected regions (e.g. North Atlantic), a cut to one cable usually results in traffic re-routing automatically through others, often with users none the wiser. Indeed, an estimated 150-200 cable faults occur annually 55, yet most go unnoticed by the public because operators engineer alternate routes 56. However, where redundancy is limited, a single incident can cause major outages.

**Clustering and Co-Routing:** A major concern is that many supposedly "separate" cables actually follow the same route or land at the same station, creating latent single points of failure. As noted, multiple cables often cluster through geographic chokepoints or single landing stations, meaning one accident can take out several at once. For example, the February 2024 Red Sea incident saw three independent cable systems cut by one ship's anchor 27. In May 2024, a separate cut of two cables (EASSy and SEACOM) in South Africa simultaneously dropped all East Africa-South Africa connectivity 57. In such cases, having multiple cables didn't help because they weren't diverse - all ran through the same bottleneck.

**Lack of Alternatives:** Certain countries or regions rely on just one or two main cables—true single points of failure. For instance, Mauritania had a single international cable (ACE) until recently; when it was cut in 2018, the entire country lost internet for two days. Many Small Island Developing States (Pacific islands, parts of the Caribbean) also depend on a single subsea link. Even at a continental scale, Africa's connectivity long hinged on only a few routes up North and around South - recent cuts have exposed weak points (e.g. West Africa's reliance on the WACS cable, which when cut in 2020 and 2021 severely reduced bandwidth to multiple countries). Vietnam in early 2023 was another stark example: all five cables cut = 75% capacity loss, no full backup for months 43.

**Redundancy Measures:** Telecom operators are increasingly investing in route diversity to avoid these scenarios. For example, after the Feb 2024 Red Sea cuts, African carriers like Kenya's Safaricom announced they were activating alternate routes and capacity on unaffected cables (like the TEAMS cable via a different route) to keep data flowing 58 59. Many countries now mandate or encourage operators to use at least two different submarine routes. However, true redundancy is costly and not always possible given geography and politics. Permitting constraints mean cables often end up laying in the same narrow corridors (e.g. Red Sea, Malacca), undermining physical diversity 60 61.

**Role of Cable Maintenance Capacity:** Even when alternate paths exist, limited repair capacity can turn a minor fault into a prolonged outage—effectively a single point of failure in time. There are only ~80 dedicated cable ships in the world 62, and repairs need skilled crews and favorable weather. If multiple cables break at once, or in wartime, repair delays can stack up. Notably, repair times have been rising - the average restoration time reached ~40 days in 2023 63, up from ~20 days in prior years. In remote regions like Africa or South America, a single available repair ship might have to triage multiple breaks. The Insikt (Recorded Future) analysis found that the worst recent outages (Red Sea, West Africa, South Africa 2024) all combined limited redundancy, co-located cables, and slow repair logistics 64 65. In other words, it's the intersection of these factors that causes systemic failure.

**Consequences of Single Points:** When redundancy fails, the impacts can be severe. Beyond slowing consumer internet, real economic damage occurs: e.g., the 2008 Mediterranean cable cuts (SEA-ME-WE-4 and others near Egypt) disrupted service to 75 million users from the Middle East to South Asia 66. In that event, 60 million in India lost or saw degraded connectivity, along with 12 million in Pakistan and 6 million in Egypt 67 49. International trading and outsourcing were hampered for days. Financial networks like SWIFT, which rely on global data links, experienced delays - at one point in 2008 some banks had to revert to backup satellite links (with high latency and low bandwidth) to process transactions. In 2016, a cable cut near Hainan isolated multiple Chinese cities from the global internet for half a day, illustrating even major economies can be caught off-guard by a single break if routes are insufficiently diverse.

In summary, true resilience requires both physical route diversity and fast restoration capability. The reality, however, is that many global regions still have obvious single points of failure. The table below summarizes a few examples:

| Region/Route | Chokepoint / Single Point | Redundancy Level | Impact if Cut |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Europe-Asia (via Egypt)** | Suez & Red Sea chokepoint (all cables) 25 | **Low** - no alternative route (all traffic funnels here) 24 | **Huge** ~70% Europe-Asia traffic affected by one incident 32; multi-continent outages |
| **Taiwan** | Limited cables (few routes via Luzon Strait) | **Low** - 2 main southbound cables often cut 36 | **High** - island could be isolated; 75%+ capacity loss if both cut |
| **South China Sea** | Many cables but contested waters | **Moderate** alternate routes far around (via Pacific) | **High** - frequent minor cuts; conflict could sever all, causing major intra-Asia latency increases |
| **West Africa** | Landing clusters (e.g. Abidjan) | **Low** - few cables, often co-located 68 | **High** - multi-country outages; e.g. 2024 slide cut all 4 cables off West Africa at once |
| **US-EU (N. Atlantic)** | Multiple cables, clustered landings | **High** capacity, but clustered landings (UK/US) | **Moderate** - capacity allows reroute, but sabotage at landing could hit several cables |
| **Pacific NW - Japan** | Multiple cables in single seismic zone | **Moderate** routes close together across Pacific | **High** - major quake/tsunami could cut most Trans-Pac links at once, isolating regions temporarily |
| **Small nations (islands)** | Often a single international cable | **Very low** - satellite backup only | **High** - complete outage of internet/voice until repaired (weeks) |

As the table suggests, a lack of route options (Egypt, Taiwan, islands) or co-location of "diverse" cables (West Africa, Red Sea) leaves several high-impact single failure points in the global network.

## Historical Cable Failures and Outages: Lessons Learned

Examining past cable failure incidents helps illustrate the real-world impacts and drive home the importance of resiliency. Below are case studies of major outages and their consequences:

* **2008 Mediterranean & Gulf Outages:** In early 2008, a cluster of inexplicable cable cuts struck the Middle East, India, and Southeast Asia. On January 30, 2008, both the SEA-ME-WE 4 and FLAG Europe-Asia cables were cut just off Alexandria, Egypt 49 69. Within two days, additional cuts hit the FALCON cable in the Persian Gulf and other segments 70. All told, at least 9 cuts occurred in a two-week span 49 50. Whether due to ship anchors in bad weather or sabotage was never definitively proven, but the effect was clear: up to 75 million internet users lost service or suffered major slowdowns 67. India lost 50-60% of its international capacity, disrupting outsourcing operations and stock trading. In the Middle East, Egypt and Gulf states saw 70% outages; even African and European networks felt the squeeze as traffic rerouted. Some banks in Bahrain reported SWIFT payment delays. The incident was a wake-up call that "networked" infrastructure could have hidden single points: at that time, both major Europe-Asia cables ran through the same patch of Mediterranean seabed. The 2008 episode spurred investments in new cables (e.g. IMEWE, EIG) to avoid such two-cable choke in the future. However, it also revealed poor coordination, as multiple consortia didn't realize they'd all chosen almost identical routes near Alexandria.
* **2016-2017 Brexit Cable Cuts:** A lesser-known but illustrative event occurred in 2016 when separate cable breaks in the English Channel and off Scotland cut some of the UK's external connectivity. While not a total outage, these incidents slowed London's financial data links. Traders noted increased latency between London and Frankfurt/New York, impacting algorithmic trading slightly until traffic was rerouted. It highlighted that even in well-cabled regions, specific low-latency routes (e.g. used by financial firms) can be single-threaded for speed, and vulnerable. After this, some financial networks diversified to use multiple cable routes (trading a few milliseconds for resiliency).
* **2019 Tonga Outage:** In January 2019, the isolated Pacific nation of Tonga went completely offline when its only international cable was severed by what appeared to be a ship's anchor. The entire country (over 100,000 people) had no internet or international phone for 11 days. Only a few satellite links provided minimal connectivity for government and banks. The economic impact on Tonga was severe (e.g. halting of credit card processing, disruption of emergency services). This was a stark demonstration of a single point of failure—and after repair, Tonga and its neighbors accelerated plans for a second redundant cable.
* **2022 / 2023 Baltic and North Sea incidents:** As noted earlier, several Northern European cable incidents occurred against the backdrop of the Ukraine war. In one, the Shetland Islands (UK) lost connectivity in October 2022 after a subsea cable from the mainland was cut (likely by fishing gear). The islands were isolated for nearly a day (with emergency calls and flights disrupted) until a backup microwave radio link was established. Around the same time, cables between Estonia, Finland, and Sweden saw suspicious breaks. While each incident individually was contained, together they signaled a new era of potential hybrid warfare targeting infrastructure. European responses included deploying undersea drones to monitor cables and establishing NATO coordination on protecting undersea infrastructure.
* **February 2024 Red Sea Cable Cuts:** Detailed earlier, this event stands out for its scale. A ship (MV Rubymar) damaged by a missile sank and dragged its anchor, simultaneously severing AAE-1, EIG, and SEACOM/Tata cables 71. The immediate result: 25% of global internet traffic between Europe and Asia went dark 72, and connectivity in at least 8 African countries dropped 20-40% overnight 31. Banks in Kenya and Tanzania lost connections to European servers, forcing delayed transactions. Cloud services in South Asia saw latency skyrocket as traffic detoured via the long Pacific route. With three cables down at once, remaining routes couldn't fully compensate, revealing that redundant capacity was not truly sufficient 72. Recovery took months - as mentioned, political roadblocks in Yemen delayed repairs, and by May 2024 the cables were still not fixed 30 57. This case underscores how a regional conflict (Yemen war) can create multi-country internet crises, and it validated warnings that physical chokepoints like Bab-el-Mandeb are high-value targets for asymmetric warfare 8.
* **Vietnam 2023 Cable Crisis:** From late 2022 into early 2023, Vietnam suffered an unprecedented scenario where all five of its undersea cables were damaged around the same time 44 (some cut in the SCS, others in Pacific typhoon zones). By February 2023, Vietnam had lost three-quarters of its international bandwidth 43. Internet users experienced crippling slowdowns, and Vietnam's large export manufacturing sector felt the pinch with data links to global partners badly reduced. With so many cables down, traffic had to traverse circuitous paths through other Asian countries. The situation dragged on because repair ships were busy elsewhere and awaiting permits—a microcosm of how limited repair assets can amplify an outage. It took until late November 2023 to fully restore all cables 44. This 8-month ordeal likely cost Vietnam's economy tens of millions of dollars and led the government to announce plans to triple the number of subsea cables by 2030 (to 15) to avoid future repeats 73.

**Impacts on Finance and AI/Cloud:** These incidents have shown concrete impacts on critical services:

* **Financial Networks:** High-frequency trading and banking networks depend on low-latency links. Even minor slowdowns (milliseconds) can impact automated trading; major cable cuts can halt transactions. For example, during the 2024 Red Sea outage, African banks reported being unable to process international payments for hours. The SWIFT system itself routes over the internet; while it is resilient, a country cut off from subsea cables would effectively be cut off from SWIFT messaging (unless satellite backup is in place), meaning no cross-border payments. The Eurasia analysis emphasized that even brief disruptions can ripple across financial markets, slowing exchanges and delaying payments. In worst cases, markets might need to pause trading if links between global financial centers fail.
* **Cloud & AI Compute:** Cloud providers distribute data and workloads across continents; AI training often involves data stored in multiple regions. Undersea cables thus form the backbone for data center replication and user access globally. A large cloud region (say in Europe) losing connectivity to another (US or Asia) could degrade services or force rerouting that adds latency. Some latency-sensitive applications—e.g. interactive AI inference, video conferencing, real-time analytics—cannot tolerate long detours. In 2021, Google reported that a cut in its private cable impacted its internal traffic for machine learning syncing, causing delays in model training until failovers kicked in. The TeleGeography report notes that demand for new cables is now driven by AI applications requiring ultra-low latency 74—meaning any increase in latency from a cut is detrimental. Thus, outages don't just inconvenience netizens; they can throttle AI and cloud services (for instance, a transpacific cable cut in 2022 forced some Asia-Pacific users of AWS and Azure to connect via Europe, doubling latency to cloud servers).

In summary, past failures teach that redundancy, diversity, and rapid repair are key. They also highlight emerging threats (intentional attacks) on top of the usual accidental breaks. The next section looks at future infrastructure projects in this context—will new cables reduce these risks, or could geopolitical rivalries create new choke-points?

## Emerging Infrastructure Projects: Geopolitics of New Cables

The undersea cable landscape is entering a new phase of growth and competition. Dozens of new cables are planned through 2026, many backed by either Chinese or U.S.-aligned interests, and tech giants ("hyperscalers") have become dominant investors 75. These developments carry both opportunities for improved resilience and new strategic risks:

* **China's "Digital Silk Road" vs. U.S. Network Exclusion:** The U.S.-China rivalry is manifesting under the oceans. China's HMN Technologies (ex-Huawei Marine) and state-linked firms are financing new cable routes that skirt traditional hubs. A prime example is the PEACE cable (Pakistan & East Africa Connecting Europe), built by HMN and fully operational in 2024 76. PEACE stretches from Asia to Africa and up to Europe, but interestingly bypasses India (China's regional rival) and makes stops in Pakistan, East Africa, and Egypt 77. It's essentially a China-aligned route linking friendly markets. In contrast, Western-backed consortia have pushed cables like SEA-ME-WE 6, set to go live in 2026, built by U.S.-based SubCom with a diverse consortium 76. SEA-ME-WE 6 will connect Southeast Asia, India, the Middle East and land in Western Europe—covering places PEACE doesn't (like India) 78. Both cables aim to carry huge capacity between Asia and Europe, but their pathways reflect strategic choices: the China-backed PEACE goes where Chinese influence is solid (Pakistan, African partners) and possibly avoids India; the SEA-ME-WE6, with U.S. support, ensures India's inclusion and leverages more neutral territory. This bifurcation could lead to parallel infrastructures - one Chinese-led, one Western-led - which might reduce some chokepoints (more cables overall) but also create political dependencies (e.g. countries on PEACE might depend heavily on Chinese tech/support). A note of concern: in early 2025, the PEACE cable was mysteriously severed near the Suez/Gulf of Suez - suspicions arose whether this was sabotage given the sensitive timing. It disrupted connectivity on that new route for three weeks 79. Such incidents hint that in a conflict, adversaries may target each other's cables. A Chinese-built cable could be seen as fair game for Western special forces (and vice versa), potentially fragmenting the global network in wartime.
* **Avoidance of Chinese Territory:** Following U.S. security agencies' concerns, no new U.S.-to-Asia cables now land in Hong Kong or China. In fact, at least three cables that would have connected Hong Kong to the U.S. were blocked by the U.S. government 46. As a result, recent transpacific cables are re-routed to land in Taiwan, the Philippines, or Indonesia, and then on to Singapore or Japan - avoiding Chinese waters. Additionally, three major U.S.-financed transpacific cables were recently rerouted south of the South China Sea (through Indonesian and Philippine waters) due to U.S. lobbying 80 81. This reduces exposure to Chinese-controlled areas but has led to longer routes. The U.S. FCC is also moving to ban Chinese equipment (Huawei, ZTE) in cable landing stations and prohibit direct China connectivity for security 82. The strategic implication is a decoupling: if an "iron curtain" were to descend, we might have largely separate Eastern and Western cable networks with only a few monitored interconnects. In the near term, however, this stance is prompting surge in alternate routes—for instance, instead of a straight Hong Kong-California cable, companies built the "Southern Cross NEXT" and are building "Apricot" and "Bifrost" cables that go via Guam, the Pacific Islands, or Australia to connect Asia and America, thereby circumventing the South China Sea. This gives more resilience (more paths), but also means more undersea miles (higher latency) and underscores that geopolitics now dictates cable paths more than pure engineering.
* **Hyperscalers and Private Cables:** Content providers (Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon) have transformed the cable industry. They now own or co-own over 59 international submarine cables, up from just 20 in 2017 75. These companies prioritize routes that connect their data centers and ensure low latency for their services. For example, Google alone owns >10 cables outright (e.g. Dunant, Curie, Equiano) 83, and participates in many more. Meta (Facebook) is investing in a massive new cable of its own (~40,000 km) to connect multiple continents 84. Hyperscaler cables often have extremely high capacity (because these firms have nearly insatiable AI/data demand)—the 2Africa cable (backed by Meta and partners) will encircle Africa with a staggering design capacity of up to 180 Tbps on key segments. The benefit of this trend is more total cables and diversity: private cables add routes that consortia (telcos) might not have, and they tend to build on varied paths to improve robustness. For instance, Google's upcoming "Australia Connect" network will create a new route from Singapore to the U.S. via Australia and the Pacific, explicitly to avoid the contested South China Sea and provide alternate paths 85 86. As Vocus (a partner) noted, Asia-US traffic is now going through Australia because no new cables were built via the South China Sea since 2017 due to right-of-way issues 48. Australia thus emerges as a new hub (considered low-risk politically, albeit longer distance). Hyperscalers drive such developments to guarantee their network resilience. However, private control can also mean less transparency - these firms can route traffic internally without involving telecom carriers, potentially obscuring failure impact or complicating cooperative restoration (though in practice they usually still cooperate on repairs).
* **New Capacity vs. Chokepoints:** The world is seeing a boom in cable construction: an estimated $11 billion in new cables is planned for 2024-2026, about double the previous three years 87. This will add hundreds of thousands of km of cable. Many are aimed at increasing route diversity - e.g., multiple new cables to Guam (9 new systems) and Singapore (7 new) are scheduled after 2024 to bolster connectivity outside risky areas 18. Guam, in particular, is being positioned as a secure relay between Asia and the U.S. (Guam is a U.S. territory, so seen as secure, and it lies conveniently in the Pacific). Japan is also expanding its cable links as a redundancy hub in Asia 88. While this explosion of cables should alleviate congestion and provide alternatives, it might also shift chokepoints rather than eliminate them. For example, if Guam becomes the nexus for many new routes, then Guam itself becomes a strategic choke (albeit one under heavy U.S. protection). Similarly, more cables landing in Singapore means Singapore's already large landing cluster grows - raising the stakes for that one city-state's security (Singapore is stable, but an incident there could now impact even more cables).
* **Competition and Security Concerns:** The risk of cable tampering or espionage is also shaping projects. Western governments worry that Chinese-built cables could have backdoors or be tapped at landing stations. Conversely, China worries about U.S. surveillance on cables landing in allied countries. This has led to efforts to secure landing stations and use encryption in cable transmission. The EU's cybersecurity agency ENISA warned in 2023 that landing stations are vulnerable to espionage or even missile attacks in conflict 89. Thus, new projects often include hardened landing infrastructure (secured premises, backup power, etc.). The U.S. Cable Security Fleet (two dedicated repair ships under U.S. flag) was established to ensure quick repairs on cables of national security importance 90 91. Likewise, other countries are considering nationalizing or subsidizing cable repair capabilities as strategic assets.

In summary, new cables are adding capacity and alternate routes - which is positive for resilience - but the political bifurcation of cable consortia (China vs West) could introduce strategic vulnerabilities. If the internet bifurcates, countries may have to choose which cable network to align with, and adversaries might target cables as part of larger conflicts. The ideal outcome is that more cables = more redundancy for all; the risk is that more cables just create two siloed networks, each with its own chokepoints.

## Strategic Significance for AI, Cloud, and Global Stability

Submarine cables are often described as the "physical backbone" of the internet—an almost invisible infrastructure that makes our digital, cloud-driven world possible. The stability of this cable network has direct implications for global economic and security stability, especially as we enter an era of AI-driven services and ultrafast communications. Key strategic considerations include:

* **Global AI Infrastructure:** AI research and deployment are international endeavors. Training cutting-edge AI models often involves moving petabytes of data between data centers across continents - for example, an AI firm might collect data in Europe, store it in U.S. cloud servers, process it in Asia, etc. This is only feasible because of high-bandwidth submarine cables. Moreover, AI applications like autonomous vehicles or financial AI require low-latency links to function in real-time across regions. Thus, cable latency and capacity directly affect AI capabilities. TeleGeography explicitly notes that the growth of AI and cloud is driving demand for ultra-low latency routes 74. If key cables were cut, AI model training could be delayed (due to slow data transfer), and inference services might degrade for users far from compute centers. In extreme cases, a region cut off from undersea cables might fall behind in AI development simply due to lack of access to global datasets and cloud computing power.
* **Cloud Services and Enterprise Operations:** The global cloud (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc.) relies on redundant cable connectivity to guarantee availability and speedy access. Multinational companies run critical operations on cloud platforms that may reside halfway around the world. Without cables, high-speed access to these platforms would vanish. Even a short disruption can be costly: consider a stock exchange that outsources its matching engine to an overseas cloud - a cable cut could literally halt trading. Many cloud providers have begun deploying edge nodes closer to users to mitigate latency, but the core data still syncs over oceans. In 2021, an extended outage of a transatlantic cable required one cloud provider to re-route European traffic via Asia-Pacific to reach U.S. servers, doubling transit time. This event pushed financial services firms to demand contractual guarantees on network routes. Fundamentally, cables underpin the promise of the cloud as "always on, everywhere" - a break undermines that promise.
* **Financial Stability:** Beyond the technical, there's a confidence aspect. The global financial system assumes that communications are instantaneous and reliable. If a major outage made it clear that, say, SWIFT messages could be significantly delayed or lost, it could sow uncertainty in markets. Imagine if during a geopolitical crisis, rumors spread that undersea cables were cut - even before the effects manifest, markets could react negatively (as such an event could impede cross-border capital flows). Thus, cables are part of the systemic risk calculus for finance. For this reason, central banks and organizations like the IMF have quietly begun including undersea cable disruption scenarios in their crisis planning 92. We've also seen energy logistics affected: in 2022, a cable cut also took down a critical European gas pipeline's data link 51, requiring manual intervention. So the interdependencies run deep—telecommunications outages can cascade into energy and finance disruptions.
* **National Security and Defense:** Modern military operations and alliances (e.g. NATO) depend on rapid data sharing—much of which goes through civilian undersea cables. Intelligence-sharing, command-and-control, even drone feeds often rely on these links (albeit encrypted). An adversary that severs cables could impede military coordination across the Atlantic or Pacific. For example, U.S. military comms to Europe often piggyback on commercial cables; multiple cuts could force reliance on slower satellite links. This is why protecting cables has become a security priority. NATO now has a Cell for Undersea Infrastructure Protection, and exercises have simulated cable sabotage scenarios. The concern is not just outages, but also tapping - submarines can potentially attach clandestine devices to fiber-optic cables to siphon data. Although much traffic is encrypted, metadata or older systems could be exploited. Ensuring data sovereignty and security thus ties into cable network control (who builds/repairs them, where they land).
* **Resilience and Risk Mitigation:** On the policy side, there are moves to bolster resilience: the ITU and UN launched an advisory body on subsea cable resilience in late 2024 93. Its aims include improving cross-border permitting for repairs and establishing best practices to prevent accidents 94. Industry groups like the International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC) work on guidelines (e.g. route spacing, burial depth) to reduce cuts. Some mitigation ideas being discussed or implemented:
* **Route Diversity Enforcement:** Regulators may require new cables to take geographically separate paths from existing ones where feasible (to avoid too many eggs in one basket).
* **Cable Armoring and Burial:** In shallow, high-traffic areas, double-armored cable and deeper burial can protect against fishing/anchors (though not perfect).
* **Rapid Repair Agreements:** Joint initiatives to station more repair ships in high-risk regions (or use naval assets in emergencies) to cut response times.
* **Monitoring and Surveillance:** New technologies (underwater drones, acoustic sensors) to monitor cable routes for suspicious activity. E.g., Norway and the UK are deploying sensor networks around key cables to detect tampering or dragging.
* **Alternate Technologies:** As a long-term idea, some have floated high-altitude platform stations or low-earth orbit satellite constellations as backup for cable routes, to provide emergency bandwidth if cables are cut. However, satellite capacity (<1% of international traffic today) cannot yet match fiber; it's more of a last resort for critical traffic.



Finally, risk matrices can help prioritize where investment and protection are most needed. One way to score risk is by combining hazard probability, choke severity, and impact magnitude. By that measure:

* **Red Sea/Egypt:** Hazard (conflict + accident) = High; Choke Severity = Very High (all cables); Impact = Global. => **Extreme Risk**.
* **Taiwan/SCS:** Hazard (political + frequent fishing cuts) = High; Choke = High; Impact = High (regional + strategic). => **High Risk**.
* **Atlantic:** Hazard (deliberate sabotage possible, natural low) = Medium; Choke = Medium (many cables but clustered landings); Impact = High (global finance). => **Medium-High Risk**.
* **Pacific:** Hazard (earthquake high in places) = Medium-High; Choke = Medium (multiple diverse routes exist, but regional clustering); Impact = High (big economies). => **High Risk** for specific scenarios (e.g. Cascadia quake).
* **Local single-country cables:** Hazard = Medium (accidents happen); Choke = Absolute (only one cable); Impact = Low globally, Very High locally. => **High Risk** for that country's connectivity.

These assessments underline that ensuring resilience of submarine cables is now a critical strategic priority for nations. The stakes - from everyday connectivity to the stability of financial and AI systems - demand a coordinated international approach to secure these undersea arteries. Robust investment in redundancy, cooperative security measures, and emergency preparedness will be needed to prevent the next cable crisis from spiraling into a broader economic or security catastrophe. As one expert noted, the world's submarine cables were "built for an era of cooperation, not conflict" 95—adapting them to today's realities is an urgent task for both industry and governments.
