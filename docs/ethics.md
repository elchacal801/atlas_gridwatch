# Ethics & Safety Policy

**Atlas Gridwatch** is a strategic intelligence platform. Its power comes from the aggregation and analysis of open data. With this power comes the responsibility to protect privacy, security, and the integrity of the open internet.

## Core Principles

### 1. No Targeting
We do not aggregate or publish data that facilitates direct cyber-attacks, physical sabotage, or harassment of individuals.
- **Excluded**: Precise employee home addresses, internal IP addresses of non-public infrastructure, unpatched vulnerability specifics.
- **Included**: Publicly listed facility locations, announced cable landing stations, autonomous system numbers (ASNs).

### 2. Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) Only
We strictly utilize Open Source Intelligence.
- We do **NOT** use: Stolen data, leaked credentials, "hack-and-leak" dumps, or data obtained through unauthorized access.
- We **DO** use: Public filings, press releases, technical documentation, academic research, and satellite imagery.

### 3. Separation of Fact and Assessment
In intelligence products, ambiguity can lead to miscalculation.
- **Facts**: Confirmed observation (e.g., "Company X filed a permit for a 50MW facility in Location Y").
- **Assessments**: Analysis derived from facts (e.g., "Company X is likely expanding its AI training capacity in the region").
- **Confidence Levels**: All assessments must carry a confidence tag (High/Moderate/Low).

### 4. Responsible Disclosure
If our analysis uncovers a critical, immediate security vulnerability in critical infrastructure (not just a strategic insight), we will follow standard responsible disclosure protocols with the relevant entity before any public release.

## Data Provenance
Every data point in Atlas Gridwatch must be traceable to a source. "Unknown" sources are treated with low confidence or excluded.
