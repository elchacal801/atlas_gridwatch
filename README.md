# Atlas Gridwatch
**Strategic Intelligence on Global Compute & Connectivity Infrastructure**

> **STATUS**: Pre-Alpha / Active Development
> **MISSION**: To map, analyze, and visualize the global physical backbone of AI, cloud compute, and digital power for strategic intelligence purposes.
> **ACCESS**: [**Live Intelligence Portal**](https://elchacal801.github.io/atlas_gridwatch/)

## Mission & Purpose
Atlas Gridwatch is a continuously maintained, intelligence-grade platform. It goes beyond static mapping to generate **strategic intelligence** regarding:
- **Geopolitical Intent**: How nations project power through digital infrastructure.
- **Corporate Strategy**: The physical footprint of hyperscalers and sovereign clouds.
- **Systemic Risk**: Concentration, chokepoints, and resilience of the global grid.

## Core Capabilities
1. **Multi-Source Ingestion**: Aggregating data from regulatory filings, industry datasets, and satellite-derived analysis.
2. **Unified Intelligence Schema**: Normalizing disparate data into a coherent model of *Locations*, *Assets*, and *Ownership*.
3. **Strategic Visualization**: High-signal visual analytics designed for intelligence briefings and decision support.

## Strategic Objectives
Atlas Gridwatch is designed to answer specific Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIRs):

### 1. Maritime Resilience & Chokepoints (Systemic Risk)
- **Objective**: Monitor the physical vulnerability of the global subsea cable network.
- **Focus**: Identify single points of failure (Straits of Malacca, Suez, Luzon) where kinetic or hybrid disruption could sever global connectivity.
- **Metric**: Betweenness centrality of landing stations and cable density in contested waters.

### 2. Frontier AI Strategy (Geopolitical Intent)
- **Objective**: Map the expansion of "Frontier AI" and Hyperscale compute facilities.
- **Focus**: Detect where major powers (US, China) and corporations (Google, Microsoft, xAI) are positioning future compute capacity.
- **Insight**: Correlate data center builds with energy availability and geopolitical alignment.

### 3. Synthesis & Interdependency
- **Objective**: Understand the "Digital Supply Chain" from subsea cable -> landing station -> data center.
- **Focus**: How does new AI infrastructure rely on legacy maritime chokepoints? Where are the new critical nodes emerging?
